# Smart-thermostst-project


Hi Guys i have implemented  the project the smart thermostat have  a look

Project Overview
The project aims to develop a smart thermostat capable of
remote operations via UART, utilizing a modified HTTP
request format. It includes encryption for secure
communication and simple authentication to ensure
authorized access. The system will parse JSON payloads
for data handling and apply basic energy-saving
algorithms to optimize HVAC system usage.

 Main Application
Detailed Requirements:
Sensor Interaction: Implement a module for accurate
and reliable temperature readings. This includes
calibration routines and error compensation.
User Commands: Develop a command processor to
interpret requests from the UART interface, adjusting
the thermostat's operation as needed.
Scheduling: Allow users to set temperature schedules,
including different settings for specific times of the day
or days of the week
